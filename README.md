## Project Description
This project is an online store with various html pages for anime merch. It has a functional cart where items from the catalogue page and the individual product pages can be sent to the cart page by clicking the add to cart button.
The importance of this project is that it makes use of Javascript to create a dynamic cart page where information changes based on the users input such as adding to cart, number in cart, delivery and using a coupon which is saved to the local storage. The totals change based on these components.

## Installation
To install locally, you can clone the repository by clicking on code and copying the link to the repository in the dropdown menu. After the link is copied, open the gitBash window and type git clone and paste the path to the repository and hit enter.

## Usage
Once the project is installed you can open the folder in a code editor and open with the live server like in visual studio code.
Navigate to the catalogue page and click on the add to cart buttons for however many items you wish.
Then click on go to cart in the navigation bar. The cart will show some form of the following:

Above are the items in the cart that I clicked to add. The total amount of each product clicked is shown. So if one item was clicked twice it will show two items in the cart and the price is doubled

The two images below show the extra option such as delivery and redeeming a coupon which can be inputed by the user. The first shows the untouched forms and the total of the products without clicking on delivery or the coupon

This one shows when the forms are used and the user clicks on delivery and redeems a coupon. The totals are shown for everything the user chose.
